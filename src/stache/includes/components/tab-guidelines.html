<h3>
  Tabs and vertical tabs as site navigation
</h3>

<p>
  If you use tabs or vertical tabs as page navigation, each one should have an entry in the browser history with a distinct title. This enables users to select the browser's back button to return to the previous view. Tabs and vertical tabs that are used as site-level navigation contain all of a page's content and can't be dismissed.

  This option doesn't require new page announcements. The selected tab receives an updated <sky-code>aria-selected="true"</sky-code> property that is communicated to assistive technologies.
