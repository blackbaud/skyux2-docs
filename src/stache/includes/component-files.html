To <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/basics/edit-project">create a component</a>, you create two files: a <sky-code>.component.ts</sky-code> file to define the component and its functionality and a <sky-code>.component.html</sky-code> file to provide a template for the component. You can also create a matching <sky-code>.scss</sky-code> file to extend the CSS for the component. If a component is shared across an application, place the files in the <sky-code>src/app/shared</sky-code> folder. Otherwise, place them in the same folder as its pageâ€™s <sky-code>index.html</sky-code> file.
