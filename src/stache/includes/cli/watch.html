<sky-code>--watch</sky-code> â€” Keeps Karma open at runtime to watch the file system for changes. The <sky-code>watch</sky-code> flag monitors changes to pact tests in much the same way that the <sky-code>serve</sky-code> command monitors the SPA for changes, but for pact testing, it is always running, much like debug mode in Visual Studio. If you change a pact test, the window is watching that and runs the test. This command is useful when writing a bunch of tests.
