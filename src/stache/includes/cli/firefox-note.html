  To serve in Firefox, you must add a certificate exception. To add the exception through the browser, run <sky-code>skyux serve -b firefox -l local</sky-code> to launch the local URL (or <sky-code>skyux serve -l local</sky-code> if Firefox is the default browser). When the browser displays a warning that the connection is not secure, select <strong>Advanced</strong> and then select <strong>Accept the Risk and Continue</strong>.
