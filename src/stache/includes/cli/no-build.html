<sky-code>--no-build</sky-code> â€” Prevents the SKY UX CLI from building the current SPA into the <sky-code>dist/</sky-code> folder before running tests. This option is useful to debug tests. For example, if developers are working on end-to-end tests but are not making any other changes to their applications, they can initially run <sky-code>skyux e2e</sky-code> to run the tests. Then as they make changes to their e2e tests, they can run <sky-code>skyux e2e --no-build</sky-code> to test the changes without performing the build step.
