Note that in the sample unit tests, the <stache-code>configureTestingModule</stache-code> function imports <stache-code>SkyAppTestModule</stache-code>. This module brings in all of your SPA's components and modules for testing convenience. This can negatively impact the performance of tests, so don't import <stache-code>SkyAppTestModule</stache-code> in your unit tests if they don't require access to all components and modules. Instead, import the individual components that your test requires and any modules that those components rely on.
