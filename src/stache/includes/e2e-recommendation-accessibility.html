  <p>
    SKY UX generally recommends using unit tests instead of end-to-end tests based on <a href="https://angular.io/guide/testing#why-not-rely-on-e2e-tests-of-dom-integration">Angularâ€™s guidance on testing</a>, but accessibility tests are an exception to the rule. For information about end-to-end tests in SKY UX, see <a routerLink="/learn/reference/tests">the tests reference</a>.
