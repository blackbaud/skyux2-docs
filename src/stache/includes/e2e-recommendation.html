We strongly recommend that you use unit tests instead of end-to-end tests based on <a href="https://angular.io/guide/testing#why-not-rely-on-e2e-tests-of-dom-integration">Angular’s guidance on testing</a>, which describes many advantages of unit tests over e2e tests. SKY UX guidance is to only use e2e tests as a last resort when you can’t use Angular’s testing framework to examine or interact with the DOM.
