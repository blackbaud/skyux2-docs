      SKY UX provides various form container patterns to accommodate different scenarios and workflow requirements.
    </p>
  </stache-page-summary>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Inline panel
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    An inline panel is appropriate for simple forms that meet the following criteria:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The form has few fields, and its input controls are not complex.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The content that surrounds the form will not distract users.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The task is functionally non-modal, and users can abandon it while the form is open.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Modal dialog
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    A <a routerLink="/components/modal">modal</a> dialog is appropriate for forms that meet any of the following criteria:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The task is functionally modal, and users must finish it before doing anything else.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Displaying the form inline would lead to substantial content shifting or require users to scroll to complete the form.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The form adds records from a paginated list or an infinite scroll list.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Full-page modal
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    A <a routerLink="/components/modal">full-page modal</a> is appropriate for forms that meet the following criteria:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The task is functionally modal, and users must finish it before doing anything else.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Users usually perform the task in a large viewport, and a full-page modal can optimize the use of space.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The context of the task is self-contained.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The form displays ancillary information or previews such as running totals or an email being constructed.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The form supports a complex task for a list of objects such as filling out report cards for a class.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The task includes subtasks that need to be completed in context.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Sectioned form
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    A <a routerLink="/components/sectioned-form">sectioned form</a> is appropriate for forms that meet the following criteria:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Users are navigating into a hierarchy and can be expected to know what they are looking for. This is common for editing pieces of a larger record and for tasks such as applying filters.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        It’s beneficial to group related but independent forms to simplify the UI on the page. For example, one “Add filters” button instead of “Filter by giving,” “Filter by status,” “Filter by constituent code,” “Filter by ratings,” etc.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Sectioned forms are not appropriate when choices on one tab can affect other tabs because changes are potentially invisible or unpredictable to users.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Wizard
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    A <a routerLink="/components/wizard">wizard</a> is appropriate for forms that meet the following criteria:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The task can be divided into discrete steps.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The order of the steps is important.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        User actions in earlier steps affect later steps.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Users must complete or review the fields in every step.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Users might want to save their progress so that they can leave the form and return later.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
