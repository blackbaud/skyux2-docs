    <p>
      SKY UX components are assembled from a small set of core design elements. These design elements act as the building blocks for the components and allow you to build user interfaces that incorporate SKY UX styles and patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      To ensure consistency with SKY UX design elements, add <sky-code>@import '~@skyux/theme/scss/mixins';</sky-code> to the top of your SCSS file. Do not include <sky-code>node_modules</sky-code> in the path because the SKY UX package may not always be in the root of <sky-code>node_modules</sky-code> and <sky-code>~</sky-code> resolves the dependency in those cases.
