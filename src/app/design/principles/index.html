	Focus on the workflow
</stache-page-anchor>
	<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading">
		Keep users in context
	</h3>
	<p>Deliver what users need where they are. Don’t make them go on an expedition.</p>
	<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading">
		Structure content around tasks
	</h3>
	<p>Organize information and actions based on what users are trying to do, not on the structure of the database.</p>

<stache-page-anchor>
	Empower users
</stache-page-anchor>
	<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading">
		Provide a starting point
	</h3>
	<p>Whether it’s new users logging in for the first time or experienced users starting their day, help them get going by providing assistance and suggesting actions.</p>
	<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading">
		Offload work from users
	</h3>
	<p>Allow users to focus on higher-level tasks by synthesizing data and automating as much as possible.</p>
	<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading">
		Provide scaffolding for growth
	</h3>
	<p>Get users up to speed quickly and provide a path to get increased value out of the system over time.</p>
	
<stache-page-anchor>
	Maintain a clean, cohesive interface
</stache-page-anchor>
	<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading">
		Attention should drive behavior
	</h3>
	<p>Attention is a scarce resource. Reserve attention-calling design elements for cases where you need to drive user behavior inside or outside the system.</p>
	<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading">
		Optimize for the ecosystem
	</h3>
	<p>Use standard components as much as possible and consider designs in the full context of use so that the user experience across the ecosystem feels seamless.</p>
