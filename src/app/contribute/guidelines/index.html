  <h3>Visual Studio Code setup</h3>

  <p>Like Angular, SKY UX Components are written in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and the free <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code editor</a> is a great IDE to work with TypeScript. It supports code navigation, refactoring tools, and a host of other features that are usually only found in richer IDEs. The SKY UX team uses Visual Studio Code and has some recommendations for configuring it to work best with Angular and SKY UX. Even if you do not want to use Visual Studio Code as your editor, the following information will still be useful because extensions are available for other popular editors such as <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>, <a href="https://brackets.io">Brackets</a>, and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>.</p>

  <h3>Visual Studio Code extensions</h3>

  <p>We highly recommend the following VS Code extensions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint">TSLint</a>: This extension validates your TypeScript code against the rules specified by the <stache-code>tslint.json</stache-code> file in the SKY UX repo. TSLint runs during the CI build, so if this extension does not validate your code in VS Code, the CI build will fail.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode">EditorConfig</a>: This extension allows VS Code to recognize the <a href="http://editorconfig.org/"><stache-code>.editorconfig</stache-code></a> file to automatically enforce many of the coding conventions that the SKY UX team uses, such as indent size, trailing whitespace rules, etc. If you do not use this extension, then you will find yourself fixing a lot of TSLint errors manually instead of letting VS Code do it for you.</li>
  </ul>
