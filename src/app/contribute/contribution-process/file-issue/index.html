    <p>
      Before you start any work, file an issue. If an issue already exists, comment on it and tag the SKY UX team so that we know you intend to work on it. The sooner we discuss potential code changes, the better.

    <li>
      <p>
        Create an issue in the package's repo. Delete the default fields for reporting bugs, and describe the contribution and its potential code changes. SKY UX provides functionality through multiple repositories that target different areas of development, so use the <a stacheRouterLink="/contribute/packages">packages matrix</a> to find the appropriate repo to file your issue.

          Blackbaud developers should file issues in ADO instead of GitHub.
