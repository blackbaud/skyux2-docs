## SKY UX SDK

The SKY UX SDK is comprised of two main modules - the SKY UX CLI and the SKY UX Builder.  The CLI is globally installed whereas Builder is installed in each repository.  This allows individual SPAs to dicate the version of the builder they use.

## SKY UX CLI

The SKY UX CLI serves two main functions.

First, it's job is to make `skyux` a known command, including handling commands which make sense running from any directory.  Command such as `skyux new` and `skyux help`.

Second, it's job is to locate any plugins, either globally or locally based on the current working directory, and pass the specified command to them.

## SKY UX Builder

## SKY UX CLI Plugins

SKY UX CLI is extensible.  By following the guidelines below, it is possible to create custom commands and modules to handle those commands.

- The module must be installed globally or locally.
- The module's name must begin with either `skyux-builder` or `@skyux-sdk/builder`.
- The module must specify the `main` property in its `package.json` or contain an `index.js` in the root.  One of this is necessary in order for your module to be used with `require()`.
- The module must expose a `runCommand` method.  This method is called with two params, the requested command and an arguments object as processed by <a href="#">minimist</a>.  This method should return a boolean as to whether it successfully handled the command.

As an example of whatever file you choose to satisfy the last requirement above:

```
module.exports = {
  runCommand(command, argv) {
    switch (command) {
      case 'customCommand':
        // Do something here
        return true;

      default:
        return false;
    }
  }
}
```

## SKY UX Builder Plugins

Add the package as a dependency in `package.json`.

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "skyux-builder-plugin-example": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

In the `skyuxconfig.json` file, specify the module in the `plugins` array.  For example:

```
{
  "plugins": [
    "skyux-builder-plugin-example"
  ]
}
```

Your package must contain one of the following:
  - The `package.json` must specify the `main` property which points to a valid JavaScript file.
  - An `index.js` file in the root.

As an example of whatever file you choose to satisfy the above requirement:

```
module.exports = {
  // content = a string representation of the file's contents
  // resourcePath = the absolute path to the file
  // skyPagesConfig = the prepared config that includes skyuxconfig.json and builder's defaults
  preload(content, resourcePath, skyPagesConfig) {
    return content;
  };
}
```
