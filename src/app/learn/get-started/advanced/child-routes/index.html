  <p>
    Child routes allow you to extend the paths of parent routes and use modular, multi-view designs to display content from child routes within parents.
  </p>
  <p>
    To designate child routes in SKY UX, you prefix their directories with <sky-code>#</sky-code>. For example, to create a child route in <sky-code>src/app/about</sky-code>, you can add a <sky-code>#child</sky-code> directory: <sky-code>src/app/about/#child</sky-code>. This creates a child route for <sky-code>/about</sky-code>. You can then use <a href="https://angular.io/api/router/RouterOutlet">the <sky-code>router-outlet</sky-code> directive</a> as a placeholder in the template to dynamically display content from the child. You can also use the <sky-code>canActivateChild</sky-code> route guard to control the rendering of the route at runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
    All other routes without the <sky-code>#</sky-code> prefix continue to act as top-level routes, and if you create a directory under a child route directory without the <sky-code>#</sky-code> prefix, it acts as a top-level route instead of a child route. For example, you cannot use the <sky-code>router-outlet</sky-code> directive with the <sky-code>top-level</sky-code> directory in <sky-code>src/app/about/#child/top-level</sky-code>. For more information about child routes, see <a href="https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-4-crisis-center-feature">the Angular routing and navigation documentation</a>.
