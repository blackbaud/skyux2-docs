      This reference provides guidance on unit tests and end-to-end tests in SKY UX projects. The continuous integration layer of SKY UX runs unit tests, visual regression tests, and end-to-end tests in multiple platforms and browsers when the SPA code changes or when an SPA dependency releases a new version. It also handles staging the SPA for additional testing and validation.

    Unit tests
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    SKY UX automatically configures <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io">Karma</a> to run unit tests in the <stache-code>src/app</stache-code> folder that end with <stache-code>.spec.ts</stache-code>. Unit tests should follow <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide#!#naming">the Angular guidelines</a> for naming and storing spec files. Name them after the components or services that they test, and place them in the same folders as their components or services.
  </p>
  <p>
    The SKY UX template includes sample unit tests that <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/basics/run-tests">you can run to test the default single-page application</a>. <stache-include fileName="SkyAppTestModule-note.html"></stache-include>
  </p>
  <p>
    To run unit tests from the command line, use <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands/test">the <stache-code>skyux test</stache-code> command</a>. To run unit tests and watch the file system for changes, use <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands/watch">the <stache-code>skyux watch</stache-code> command</a>. Code coverage results are stored in the <stache-code>coverage</stache-code> folder. To specify a minimum code coverage threshold required to pass the <stache-code>skyux test</stache-code> command, use <a routerLink="/learn/reference/configuration">the <stache-code>codeCoverageThreshold</stache-code> configuration option</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    SKY UX styles are loaded when running unit tests, so CSS rules defined in SKY UX take effect during tests. This allows you to check the expected computed style of an element when using things like the HTML <stache-code>hidden</stache-code> property that only take effect when SKY UX styles are loaded.

    End-to-end (e2e) tests
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <stache-include fileName="e2e-recommendation.html"></stache-include>
  <p>
    SKY UX automatically configures <a href="http://www.protractortest.org">Protractor</a> to run end-to-end tests in the <stache-code>e2e</stache-code> folder that end with <stache-code>.e2e-spec.ts</stache-code>. End-to-end tests should follow <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide#!#naming">the Angular guidelines</a> on naming and storing spec files. Name them after the components or services that they test, and place them in the <stache-code>e2e</stache-code> folder in the root of your project.
  </p>
  <p>
    To run e2e tests from the command line, use <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands/e2e">the <stache-code>skyux e2e</stache-code> command</a>. For tips and techniques on testing Angular applications, see the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/testing">Angular testing guidelines</a>.

  <h3>
    Accessibility tests
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    SKY UX includes a tool to run automated accessibility tests within e2e tests. For information on how to use it in e2e specs and how to enable and disable rules for accessibility tests, see <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/advanced/accessibility-analyzer">the accessibility analyzer</a>.
