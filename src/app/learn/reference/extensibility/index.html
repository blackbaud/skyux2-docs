    <p>
      The SKY UX SDK includes two main modules: SKY UX CLI and SKY UX Builder. The CLI is installed globally, and Builder is installed in each repository to allow individual SPAs to specify the version to use.
    </p>
  </stache-page-summary>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    SKY UX CLI
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    The SKY UX CLI has a few main purposes.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The CLI provides <stache-code>skyux</stache-code> as a known command from any location in your system. Internally, it handles a few commands such as <stache-code>skyux new</stache-code> and <stache-code>skyux help</stache-code> that can run anywhere and are not limited to the context of an existing SPA.
    </li>
    <li>
      The CLI locates packages to handle <stache-code>skyux</stache-code> commands and passes commands to those packages. Packages can be installed globally or locally in the working directory. SKY UX Builder is the most common example of a module versioned in a specific directory that handles commands. For example, Builder handles <stache-code>skyux build</stache-code> after the CLI passes along the command.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    For information about SKY UX CLI commands, see <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands">the CLI commands reference</a>.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    SKY UX Builder
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    SKY UX Builder is intended to be listed as a <stache-code>devDependency</stache-code> in the <stache-code>package.json</stache-code> file for every SPA. Builder handles the majority of <stache-code>skyux</stache-code> commands, including testing, serving, and building, and it wraps up the logic and configuration for other tools such as the Angular Compiler, Webpack, Karma, and Protractor.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    SKY UX CLI plugins
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    SKY UX CLI is extensible. Follow these guidelines to create custom commands and modules to handle those commands:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Start the module name with <stache-code>skyux-builder</stache-code> or <stache-code>@skyux-sdk/builder</stache-code>. The SKY UX team follows the syntax <stache-code>@skyux-sdk/builder-[module-name-here]</stache-code>, but non-SKY UX creators need to use the syntax <stache-code>skyux-builder-[module-name-here]</stache-code> because they don't have access to publish to the <stache-code>@skyux-sdk/</stache-code> scope.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Enable the module for use with <stache-code>require()</stache-code> by either specifying a valid JavaScript file with the <stache-code>main</stache-code> property in the module's <stache-code>package.json</stache-code> file or by including an <stache-code>index.js</stache-code> file in the module's root.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Expose a <stache-code>runCommand</stache-code> method in the module. This method is called with two parameters: the requested command and an arguments object. It returns a boolean value to indicate whether it successfully handled the command.
      </p>
      <sky-code-block>
        module.exports = {
          runCommand(command, argv) {
            switch (command) {
              case 'customCommand':
                // Do something here
                return true;

              default:
                return false;
            }
          }
        }
      </sky-code-block>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To consume the CLI plugin after you create it, users must install the module globally or locally.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    SKY UX Builder plugins
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    SKY UX Builder is also extensible, but in a different way than SKY UX CLI. Each file that's parsed as part of your project can be modified at build time. This technique is very useful to dynamically inject common boilerplate behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create custom packages, enable the package for use with <stache-code>require()</stache-code> by either specifying a valid JavaScript file with the <stache-code>main</stache-code> property in the package's <stache-code>package.json</stache-code> or by including an <stache-code>index.js</stache-code> file in the package's root.
  </p>
  <sky-code-block>
    module.exports = {
      // content = a string representation of the file's contents
      // resourcePath = the absolute path to the file
      // skyPagesConfig = the prepared config that includes skyuxconfig.json and builder's defaults
      preload(content, resourcePath, skyPagesConfig) {
        return content;
      }
    }
  </sky-code-block>

  <p>
    To consume the Builder plugin after you create it, users must install the package globally or locally.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Users add the package as a dependency in <stache-code>package.json</stache-code>.
      </p>
      <sky-code-block>
        {
          "dependencies": {
            "skyux-builder-plugin-example": "1.0.0"
          }
        }
      </sky-code-block>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Then in the <stache-code>skyuxconfig.json</stache-code> file, they specify the module in the <stache-code>plugins</stache-code> array.
      </p>
      <sky-code-block>
        {
          "plugins": [
            "skyux-builder-plugin-example"
          ]
        }
      </sky-code-block>
    </li>
  </ul>
</stache>
