  <p>
    This reference describes naming conventions for files in SKY UX projects and rules and recommendations on where to place those. For a more information about the items that the template provides by default in SKY UX single-page applications, see <a routerLink="/learn/reference/template-items">the template items reference</a>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Root directory — There are no special requirements for the name of the root directory that you specify when <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/basics/create-project">you create a project</a>. However, you should be aware that the CLI creates a folder for the project with this name and the <sky-code>skyux-spa</sky-code> prefix. Also, it includes the root directory name in the URL for the home page of the SPA after the base URL. If you do not want the root directory in the public-facing URL, you can overwrite it with the <sky-code>name</sky-code> property of the <sky-code>skyuxconfig.json</sky-code> file.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Git repo — There are no special requirements for the name of the Visual Studio Team System Git repo or GitHub repo where you store source files for the project. However, you may want to include the <sky-code>skyux-spa</sky-code> prefix so that the repo name matches the root directory name.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>src</sky-code> folder — This working folder for the SPA contains source files for the SKY UX project. You place most files and folders for the project within this folder. The main exception is files for end-to-end tests, which you place in the <sky-code>e2e</sky-code> folder.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>src/app</sky-code> folder — This folder contains files and folders for pages, components, and unit tests. You create subfolders within the <sky-code>src/app</sky-code> folder to create items.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>src/app/shared</sky-code> folder — This folder is the recommended location for components and services that are shared across an application.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>src/app/lib</sky-code> folder — This folder is the recommended location for files to exclude from code coverage. SKY UX's code coverage instrumentation ignores all files in the <sky-code>lib</sky-code> folder.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>src/assets</sky-code> folder — To <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/advanced/include-static-assets">include static assets</a> such as images in your SPA, place them in the <sky-code>assets</sky-code> folder in the <sky-code>src</sky-code> directory. To reference files in this folder in your HTML, CSS, or SCSS, insert <sky-code>&#126;/assets/</sky-code> before the filename. For example, <sky-code>&#60;img src="&#126;/assets/photo.jpg" alt="Photo" /&#62;</sky-code> references a <sky-code>photo.jpg</sky-code> file in <sky-code>src/assets</sky-code>. You must reference static assets this way because the filenames are updated at build time to include hashes that represent the content of the files. During the CI build, files in the <sky-code>src/assets</sky-code> folder are automatically uploaded to the CDN if they are referenced in your HTML, CSS, or SCSS. Also during the CI build, all instances of <sky-code>&#126;/assets/</sky-code> are replaced with the CDN. To replace <sky-code>&#126;/assets/</sky-code> with a different value when <sky-code>skyux build</sky-code> runs, you can use the <sky-code>--assets</sky-code> option <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands">in the SKY UX CLI</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>src/assets/locales</sky-code> folder — To <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/advanced/localization">specify localization strings</a> to reuse throughout your SPA, declare the strings in the <sky-code>resources_en_US.json</sky-code> file in <sky-code>src/assets/locales</sky-code>. To reference the localization strings in your SPA, use the <sky-code>skyAppResources</sky-code> pipe or the <sky-code>SkyAppResourcesService</sky-code> service.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>SCSS</sky-code> file — This file contains the import that includes design tokens for SKY UX building styles. You can also add custom styles to this file because SCSS is a superset of CSS3 syntax. For more information, see the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS website</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>e2e</sky-code> folder — This folder is the required location to store end-to-end tests. However, we strongly recommend that you use unit tests instead of end-to-end tests based on <a href="https://angular.io/guide/testing#why-not-rely-on-e2e-tests-of-dom-integration">Angular’s guidance on testing</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Pages — SKY UX uses automatic route configuration based on a project’s folder structure. So to <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/basics/edit-project">create a page</a>, you create a subfolder in <sky-code>src/app</sky-code> and then create an <sky-code>index.html</sky-code> file for the page in that folder.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Components — <stache-include fileName="component-files.html"></stache-include>
      </p>
      <stache-include fileName="small-components.html"></stache-include>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Unit tests — Unit tests should follow <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide#!#naming">the Angular guidelines</a> on naming and storing spec files. Name them after the components or services that they test, and place them in the same folders as their components or services. SKY UX automatically configures Karma to run unit tests in the <sky-code>src/app</sky-code> folder that end with <sky-code>.spec.ts</sky-code>. When you run <sky-code>skyux test</sky-code> or <sky-code>skyux watch</sky-code>, code coverage results are stored in the <sky-code>coverage</sky-code> folder.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        End-to-end tests — We strongly recommend that you use unit tests instead of end-to-end tests based on <a href="https://angular.io/guide/testing#why-not-rely-on-e2e-tests-of-dom-integration">Angular’s guidance on testing</a>. If you must use end-to-end tests, they should follow <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide#!#naming">the Angular guidelines</a> on naming and storing spec files. Name them after the components or services that they test, and place them in the <sky-code>e2e</sky-code> folder in the root of your project. SKY UX automatically configures Protractor to run end-to-end tests in the <sky-code>e2e</sky-code> folder that end with <sky-code>.e2e-spec.ts</sky-code>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Pact tests — Pact tests should follow <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide#!#naming">the Angular naming guidelines</a> on naming and storing spec files. Name them after the components or services where they test integration with consumed services, and place them in the same folder as their components or services. SKY UX automatically configures Karma to run pact tests in the <sky-code>src/app</sky-code> folder that match the <sky-code>.pact-spec.ts</sky-code> pattern. When you run <sky-code>skyux pact</sky-code>, log files are placed in the directory that you specify in <sky-code>skyuxconfig.json</sky-code>, and pact files are stored in the <sky-code>app/pacts</sky-code> directory.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Modules — If a module is shared across an application, place it in the <sky-code>src/app/shared</sky-code> folder. Otherwise, place it in the same folder as its page’s <sky-code>index.html</sky-code> file.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Services — If a service is shared across an application, place it in the <sky-code>src/app/shared</sky-code> folder. Otherwise, place it in the same folder as its page’s <sky-code>index.html</sky-code> file.
      </p>
    </li>
<!--
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>dist</sky-code> folder – Contains files that are deployed through the continuous integration pipeline.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <sky-code>node_modules</sky-code> folder – Contains external dependencies for SKY UX components and SKY UX Builder (including system files to build the SPA). We recommend against placing this folder in source control.
      </p>
    </li>
