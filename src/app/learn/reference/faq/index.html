    How do I get the latest version of the SKY UX CLI?
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    The command to get the latest is <stache-code>npm install -g @blackbaud/skyux-cli</stache-code>. The SKY UX CLI notifies users when a new version is released. If a new version is available when users run <stache-code>skyux serve</stache-code>, then a message appears in the command prompt.

        What is the timeline to be able to deploy SKY SPAs for use in production?
    </stache-page-anchor>
    <p>
      The SKY UX Host, Builder, and CLI pieces can be used to build a production app. The Blue Steel team has done this. It just requires some manual steps and patience with some suboptimal workflow while we automate more and add more user-friendly features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only special requirement to host internal Blackbaud implementations is web hooks in the Git repo to the SKY UX continuous integration layer. For now, this must be set up manually by the SKY UX team. Contact the SKY UX team on the <a href="https://blackbaud.slack.com/messages/1bb-skyux-apps/">1bb-skyux-apps Slack channel</a>.

  <stache-page-anchor>
    For internal Blackbaud SPAs, will deployment be automated through <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-deploy">the skyux-deploy repo</a>?
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    Yes. Currently, any merge to your master branch triggers a release to production. We plan to change that to state a release with an endpoint or a user interface where you can flag staged releases as production releases.

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Do you need a separate repo for a backend to perform business logic?
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    Since the app repository exists solely for UI components, you do need a separate repo if you need a backend deployed to perform business logic or some other action.

  <stache-page-anchor>
    What browsers does SKY UX support?
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    <stache-include fileName="supported-browsers.html"></stache-include>
  </p>
  
  <stache-page-anchor>
    How do I troubleshoot a <stache-code>webpack: Failed to compile.</stache-code> error?
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    After a <stache-code>webpack: Failed to compile.</stache-code> error in the output of the <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands">serve CLI command</a>, you can review the script console in your web browser for information about the specific files with errors.
