  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    The SKY UX code framework includes a lot of built-in accessibility goodness out of the box: good semantic markup, descriptive text equivalents, support for keyboard use, support for color contrast success criteria, and ARIA roles and properties within components. Individual components also have accessibility guidelines where relevant. If you build your application with <a routerLink="learn/overview#sky-ux-builder">SKY Builder</a>, it provides an automated accessibility testing tool that tests for some accessibility criteria.

  <p>
    An accessible UX framework is an important part of Blackbaud’s commitment to deliver solutions that help drive positive change in the world. We endeavor to meet the World Wide Web Consortium’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> Level A and AA success criteria. In SKY UX, we build support for accessibility into our components.
