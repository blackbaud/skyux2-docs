    <p>
      The sectioned form module contains components to combine multiple forms and display large amounts of conceptually related information. The <stache-code>sky-sectioned-form</stache-code> component creates a container for the forms, and the <stache-code>sky-sectioned-form-section</stache-code> component creates an individual form to display as a section within the sectioned form.

	<sky-demo-page-content sectionHeading="UX guidelines">
    <p>
      A sectioned form is appropriate for forms that meet the following criteria:
    </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
        Users are navigating into a hierarchy and can be expected to know what they are looking for. This is common for editing pieces of a larger record and for tasks such as applying filters.
      </li>
			<li>
        It’s beneficial to group related but independent forms to simplify the UI on the page. For example, one “Add filters” button instead of “Filter by giving,” “Filter by status,” “Filter by constituent code,” “Filter by ratings,” etc.
      </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
      Sectioned forms are not appropriate when choices on one tab can affect other tabs because changes are potentially invisible or unpredictable to users.
    </p>
